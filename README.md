# An Introduction to Machine Learning with R


This introductory workshop on machine learning with R is aimed at
participants who are not experts in machine learning (introductory
material will be presented as part of the course), but have some
familiarity with scripting in general and R in particular. The
workshop will offer a hands-on overview of typical machine learning
applications in R, including unsupervised (clustering, such as
hierarchical and k-means clustering, and dimensionality reduction,
such as principal component analysis) and supervised (classification
and regression, such as K-nearest neighbour and linear regression)
methods. We will also address questions such as model selection using
cross-validation. The material has an important hands-on component and
readers should have a computer running R 3.4.1 or later.
